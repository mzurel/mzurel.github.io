## Bio
I am a PhD student at the University of British Columbia and the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute. My supervisor is Dr. Robert Raussendorf. I work on quantum information and quantum computing. In particular, I study quantum contextuality, negativity in quasiprobability representations, and other indicators of nonclassicality in hidden variable models, and there relation to the computational speedup of quantum computation over classical computation.
