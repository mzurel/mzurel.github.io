## Bio
![Brandywine](/files/photos/CoverPhoto.jpg){: width="400" style="float:right; padding-left:10px"}

I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of British Columbia and the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute. I work on quantum information and quantum computation under the supervision of Dr. Robert Raussendorf. In particular, I study quantum contextuality, negativity in quasiprobability representations, and other indicators of nonclassicality in hidden variable models, and there relation to the computational speedup of quantum computation over classical computation.
