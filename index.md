## Bio
![Chain Lakes Loop Trail at Mount Baker in Washington, USA](/files/photos/CoverPhoto.JPG){: width="300" style="float:right; padding-left:10px"}

I am an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University working with [Dr.&nbsp;Nadish de Silva](http://www.sfu.ca/~ndesilva/){:target="_blank"}, Canada Research Chair in the Mathematics of Quantum Computation. I work on foundations and mathematics of quantum information and quantum computation. In particular, I study quantum contextuality, negativity in quasiprobability representations, and other indicators of nonclassical physics in hidden variable models, and their relation to the computational speedup of quantum computation over classical computation.
